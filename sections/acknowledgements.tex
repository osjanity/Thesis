\section*{Acknowledgements}

\null \quad \quad Many thanks to Professor Dr. Joachim Giesen for the consistent guidance and inspiration throughout the Master's program, numerous excellent lectures, and for helping me arrive at such an engaging thesis topic. Thanks to Dr. S\"{o}ren Laue and Prof. Dr. Joachim Giesen for serving as the reviewers of the thesis. \newline
\null \quad \quad This work would not have been possible without the thoughtful and incredibly thorough feedback across intercontinental time zones from my advisor Andreas Goral.\newline 
\null \quad \quad Thanks to Tristan Kreuziger for his detailed responses to my many questions on German translations, and to Lisa and Evin for flipping coins. \newline
\null \quad \quad I would also like to briefly note that I did not particularly expect to pass my $9$th grade algebra course, and had once written off the idea of being able to learn basic calculus. Endless thanks to my many mentors, supporters, and friends along the way for the ongoing encouragement to pursue math, even when it felt against the odds of success. \newline
