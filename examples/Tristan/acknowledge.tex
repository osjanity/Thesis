I would like to thank my supervisor at Zeiss, Timo Stich, for his guidance and help over the last six months while writing this thesis. The weekly meetings and discussions about problems, preliminary results, and ultimately conclusions helped in shaping the thesis as it is and provided a very much needed structure. His impulses to various topics lead me to new discoveries and an overall more scientific approach to the topic.

I am thankful to Zeiss for letting me work in their research department in Jena, which enabled me to work with state-of-the-art hardware and leading industry applications. The real work environment was helpful not only for this thesis but for my future career in the field as well.

On the academia side, I would like to thank Professor Giesen for his supervision, his everlasting interest, and his quick help, whenever an issue came up. 

Finally, I would like to thank all the people, who read the thesis in various states along the way. They pointed out errors in writing and logic to me, which I would ultimately not have found myself in its entirety.
